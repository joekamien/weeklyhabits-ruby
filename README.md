# weeklyhabits-ruby

## Summary
There are certain weekly habits I'm trying to build. This is a simple Ruby script that can be run daily to indicate what's on the agenda for that day.

## Description
It usually makes sense to keep habits organized by project. For example a file like cleaning.txt, might contain the following:

	Monday
		dust
	Tuesday
		clean bathrooms and kitchen sinks
	etc.

When viewing habits, however, it usually makes more sense to view them by day. For example, on Monday it would be nice to see all the habits (across all projects) which are scheduled for Monday.

## Usage
The script expects a directory called "data" containing project files named "<project-name>.txt". Each project file should be organized as follows:

	Name of day (e.g., "Monday")
		(whitespace) Task 1 for that day
		(whitespace) Task 2 for that day
		etc.
	Name of another day (e.g., "Tuesday")
		(whitespace) Task 1 for that day
		(whitespace) Task 2 for that day
		etc.

When run, the script will iterate across all project files in the data directory. For each project with a task for today, it will print to standard output as follows:
> (project name) - (task name)
